I have made Blog-website Spring Boot blog website allows users to upload ,edit and delete blogs. It provides sign up, log in using JWT-based authentication. The application uses Spring Security to protect blog-related routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access them. It also allows user to sigup with github. A dynamic and conventional frontend is made as home page that displays list of blogs , where after adding blogs user can use edit delete features so far.
